SUBJECT:  Status of PAKCOP..

--------------------------------------------------------------------

     As of this memo there are two pack copy programs. PAKCOP.SAV and
     PAKCP5.SAV.

     PAKCOP.SAV is the same old pack copy which we have been using on
     the Memorex 3675's and Ampex DM-331's. You must still use this 
     program when you work with 3675's and DM-331's, but there have been
     some enhancement added to it.

     PAKCP5.SAV is the new version which only works with the Memorex 
     3650 and 3652 disks which we have started to put on the PDP10's.

     Operationally, procedures of both program are the same as before.
     Only one command REFRESH, has been changed to ZFORMAT.

     If a 3650/3652 pack can not be ZFORMATed on the PDP10 because of
     a defective track, which must be done at least once when they are
     put on the PDP10 to work with TYMCOM-X operating system, defective
     track could be rewritten (fixed) under IBM/VM system using FIDS
     SA (Surface Analysis). This has been allready tested and proven to work.

     If there is any question feel free to give me a call at (415)794-2513
     or send mail to user name OSMAN on PDP10' or FSC.O/GUVEN on ONTYM.
     Thank You..

Subject: BBOARD messages. 


Due to a limitiation in the TUMS mailing system, we cannot use the username
BBOARD.  TUMS assumes that we are trying to send mail to the UNIX BBOARD
system and snarfs up the mail...  sigh!

I've setup a mailbox for username INFO instead.  Untested as of this moment,
and this will only change if TUMS eats that mail also.  GRRRRRRR.

Bug in LS program....

  If one has UNDELETE enabled, one gets funny named .TMP files in one's
directory... when one then runs LS to get a directory, LS seems to stop
when it hits one of thes bad files... in any case, it doesn't list all
of the user's files.  Even if it doesn't print the bad names, it ought to
continue with the rest of the real files...

Re: Modifications to the system

I made some minor changes to your PRPCHG.DOC file along with one
major revision.

*** MAJOR CHANGE ***
  :RESTART n                Not implemented.  Ignored.

This is now correct!  For the sake of conversion, it is ignored for
the moment.  Later, I may add it in when the Hold$Restart stuff is
working the way I'd like it to work.


XEXEC.RND/SUBMIT.DOC

The CCL option replaces the TMPName option completely.  The old CCL option
is redundant and setting the CCL name (or parameters) will flag the proper
start condition.  If the RUN option is set and parameters are given, the
CCL name will be setup automatically from the first 3 characters of the
command file name if a CCL option HAS NOT been issued previously.

The LOGOUT option has been added to allow a running job to log itself out
without first halting and waiting for the job processor to log it out.
(Waiting to be logged out hasn't really been tested fully, while programs
such as MAILER and ONTMTP log themselves out.  This bit must be set on
these programs, otherwise they will be marked Abort-Logout).

Abort-CCL has been removed.  Apparently Abort-CCL replaced Abort-Run in
an earlier version and Abort-Run was never re-implemented.  So, I have
renamed Abort-CCL to Abort-Run since that is the intent, and I have added
a new condition Abort-Logout which means the job went away without the
job processor's knowledge.  This is now an error.!

I will change the documentation to reflect these changes.

Effective in SUBMIT %1(162), XEXEC %1(173), EXECX %1(174).

Version 1(165) and some earlier
Problem is that if you ABORT out of an insert, and possibly a modify
then proceed to insert a new record... the old record info is still
there... or at least some of it, eg. LOGFILE in my experience.

re: Weird startup problem on system 72.

I tried to startup my XEXEC on system 72 last night and it just kept
sitting there without doing anything...

I looked at the job with FRMDDT and it was looping in the code I wrote
to sleep, loop back and try again inside the call to type a message to
the CTY using the talk job SETUUO function 10.  It appears that the
SETUUO was either failing or the CTY was being flooded with output and
it was returning a pointer to use to continue the uuo.  I donno... I
put a JFCL at the error address and it took off flying.

I've not heard anything about 72 going down... so this behavior was most
bewildering.  I thought you'd like to know, because I think that we need
to address the problem of the CTY being flooded with output, such as when
a detached job has LOGOUT on STOP set and caannot logout...  "?<cr>" is
typed over and over again...

New bit for (PJ)JOBS.DAT...
  bit x = this data center

maybe better - bit field  (2-3 bits) with the data center number.
thus, all programs like SUPCHK and (SPL)COPY and the like can look
at word 1 for the host number and find that host's entry to see
what data center this machine is in... then a sub-list can be made
of those systems in this particular center.

Then, (SPL)COPY or SUPCHK can look at only those hosts...

...since you'r updating PAM...

Problem:  When rebuilding the system, do all the packs have to be the same?
Answer:   ASP dumps DSKB0, then DSKB1, etc.  It does not matter if DSKB0 has
          moved from BPA1 to BPA7.  If the system had 14 packs when ASP was
          run, then it must have 14 packs when restoring.  The physical
          location of the packs is irrelevant.

Subject: Oper password file loses license when restoring from backup tape. 

16-Nov-86 18:15/Joe
Contact:  Cupertino Operations, (408)446-7705, Vijay, System 22.
Problem:  Could not set license after restoring from 14th's incremental.
Diagnosis: TITO complained about two files:
          (SYS)DRWSPR.EPO not given license WC
          (BOFANET)ONTYME.SAV not given license AC (SY,HF,RF,WF)
Fix:      Ran SETE then SETLIC on those two files.  System now up.
Note:     Carl and I have been discussing ways of giving license to TITO
          instead of to the operators.  We need to do something about it.

In this particular case, ASP restored all files with correct license.  Now if
TITO had all the license in the world, restoring files to SYS would not lose
license.  Giving license to TITO would be OK if
  1) TITO threw away license if not run by OPER.
  2) TITO threw away license if the TRANSLATE command was given.
  3) TITO kept license only for "RESTORE ALL" and the system number in the
     header matched the current system number.  (Operators would still need
     do set RF on their frame to do a STORE operation.)

This approach would not work if (SYS)TITO.SAV got wiped out and they had to
run TITO from tape.  Right now, only REFLAG gives the operator license when
running from tape.  We could make TITO use "SETE 777777,-1" to get all license
without having to take the system down, but it may be difficult to ensure that
only TITO gets to use it, and not some malicious program.

Or we could make it a restriction that if TITO gets wiped out, they have to
take the system down to get license from ONCE.  Then we could add a "TITO"
command to ONCE that takes device name as an argument (such as SYS: or FTA0:,
etc).  This command would tell ONCE to set CONSOLE-MANUAL mode, log in OPER
(without requiring ^Z L OPER), give the process all the license in the world,
then run TITO from the specified device.  This would avoid DDT and REFLAG and
give them a one-shot license for restoring files to SYS.  Once SYS was
restored and DSKCLN run, they could use the licensed copy of TITO on disk to
restore the rest of the files.

Any comments?
