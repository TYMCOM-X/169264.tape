and manipulated by the new operator license system.  The descriptions of
the various record types will not try to explain the relationships between
each of the component parts.  The records described below may or may not
reside in the same file.

Employee Record

    The employee record is a description of an authorized individual that
    requires some particular privilege or capability that is unobtainable
    just by having a valid username on a particular host computer system.
    The information in this record is needed to track the person that is
    responsible for using a particular oper status name.  The direct line
    of corporate management may also found in this record.  (As such, it is
    possible for an employee record to exist, without any status, for the
    sole purpose of tracking an individual's manager).

    Employee Number			ISG Employee Number
    District Number			Marketing District number
    Entry Info				Date-time of entry, who entered
    Employee Name			Name of Employee
    Employee Phone			Phone number, interoffice mail stop
    Security Mail address *		TUMS mailing address
    User Name of employee **		Assigned network username(s)
    Oper Name list			Assigned oper status name(s)


*   In the event of any suspected improprieties, TUMS mail will be directed
    to this address or to the address specified in the manager's record for
    this opername.  A message may also be sent to the address designated by
    those individuals that have granted various licenses to this employee.

**  This username will be used to identify access via the appropriate network
    to the host systems designated herein.  In the event of a any suspected
    security breach the owner of this username will be contacted as well as
    other appropriate security officials.

    The usernames that may use this oper status name as designated will be
    permitted to use this opername without question.  Others will be flagged
    by the stream reader and mail will be sent to the appropriate parties.

    Note:  The oper status name belongs to the specified employee.  The main
    purpose of the username list is for those employees that use more than
    one username in the normal process of work.
    


Oper Name Record

    The Oper name record describes completely the capabilities of each
    status name associated with an individual.  An employee may have any
    number of different opernames.  Each has the same capabilities on all
    normal Tymcom-X systems.

    Oper Name				12 Character oper status name
    Password				Hashed password
    Password Change Date		Last password change date-time
    Password Change Opername		Opername for who last changed password
    Employee Number			ISG Number of employee
    District Number			Marketing District Number
    License				Accumulated license for this name

    Manager pointer			Manager opername
    First Subordinate pointer		First Subordinate (if any)
    Previous Sibling pointer		Previous Sibling (if any, 0 if first)
    Next Sibling pointer		Next Sibling (if any, 0 if last)

    License Grant pointer *		Link to list of grant records granted
    License Gift pointer  *		Link to list of grant records received
    Employee Info pointer		Index into Employee text file


*   A linked list of capabilities is kept with pointers to the oper status
    name and the employee that granted and received the capability.  This
    list allows different capabilities to be granted by different employees
    and merged into a single capability list.



Capability Grant Record

    Each capability grant record will describe a license or capability that
    is to be passed from one employee to one oper status name.  Each record
    will be linked to all capabilities for a particular oper status name and
    to all capabilities granted by an employee.  Note: The two lists thus
    linked will have no bearing on the management structure or each other.
    Thus, any employee with a capability may pass that capability to any
    oper status name.

    For reasons of security, if any capability is taken away from any
    employee, any oper status name granted license by that employee will
    also lose it's license.  To prevent problems when an employee leaves
    the company, the employee's record can be marked inactive rather than
    cancel it until capabilities passed by that employee to others can
    be "passed" by some other employee (propably one taking the place of
    the employee that is now gone).

    License grants may contain activation and termination dates.  If the
    activation date is 0, the entry date is used.  If the termination date
    is 0, no termination is assumed.

    Grantor pointer			Opername granting license
    Receiver pointer			Opername receiving license
    Grantor list link			Next grant by this grantor
    Receiver list link			Next grant for this receiver
    Activation Date			Start Date
    Termination Date			Stop  Date
    License value			License mask granted/received

    Note: Any status name may be created as a placeholder with no actual
    license capability.  Such status names may be modified later or left
    as manager rwecords for other users with valid status names.

    As part of the conversion effort, all opernames from the system password
    file will be converted to the new format and merged with information for
    each name from the appropriate individuals.  Any opername record that is
    not updated with with a valid ISG number by the designated cutoff date
    will remain in the database, but each time a new system password file is
    created said opername records will not have an entry in the password file.

				opername.  Similar to ADD and CHANGE.

    REMOVE Opername		Take license capability away from a status

				out of the list unless it is the only record.
