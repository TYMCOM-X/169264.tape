$Menu SETE;Modifications to SETE
*(CARL)LICENSE.NFO:SETE-UUO;New SETE -1 feature.
*(CARL)LICENSE.NFO:SETE-PROGRAM;Run SETE as a monitor job

$Text SETLIC;Modifications to SETLIC UUO

To reduce frame license into JBTSLC instead of throwing it away.
This will allow ENABLE and DISABLE to retrieve the previous licenses
that have been set and enable them without running OPER again.

$Text TABLES;License tables for ENABLE and DISABLE

BUild the license names and bit tables into the monitor as
    Name
    Bit-mask
    Bit-value

to allow the monitor to set or clear specific licenses using ENABLE
and DISABLE without running OPER again.

$Text SETE-UUO;New SETE -1 feature.

Add some feature to allow TITO with security restrictions to obtain all
the license there is for all-files restores so that OPER no longer needs
to worry about obtaining license before doing a restore.

Fix TITO to only copy file-license to the tape if the user is OPER and
the command given is a STORE ALL command?  Need to protect against any
intelligent life forms attempting to build a trojan horse.

$Text SETE-PROGRAM;Run SETE as a monitor job

Put the current code for the SETE program into the monitor as a command
which runs a monitor job instead of a program from SYS.  This is both
for reliability and for security.
